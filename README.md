# Heart Attack EDA and Prediction (India)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a **logistic regression model** developed to predict heart attack risk using a dataset focused on **cardiovascular health in India**.

This project represents my **first implementation of logistic regression** for making predictions on a real-world dataset.
